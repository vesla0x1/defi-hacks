# DeFi Hacks Playground
This repository aims to recreate (in)famous Ethereum transactions, similar to [DeFi Hack Labs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs/). However, it differs by not only recreating the transaction but also by providing a way to interact with vulnerable contracts. This allows to gain a better understanding of each step in the transaction's execution by creating logs and visualizing events in a flexible manner. In addition to this, another goal of this project is to provide a mechanism to modify vulnerable contracts, with the goal to mitigate the root cause of the issue and prevent hack to happen. Comprehensive write-ups of these hacks will also be included.

## Structure
Each directory of this repository is a foundry project containing:
- **/test:** foundry test emulating the transaction (fork of [DeFi Hack Labs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs/) with some changes);

- **/src:** vulnerable contracts (and its dependencies) extracted from etherscan. These contracts must have their stated restored at the block that the hack happened (for now, I am using https://evm.storage but I plan to automate this in the future);

- **README.md:** write-up of the hack with mitigation steps;

- **branches:**
  - *playground:* explore, experiment and understand better the transaction using this branch. This can contain logs and useful notes. Feel free to change whatever you want here;
  - *fix:* mitigation steps for the hack. It's like if you could go back in time and change something in the vulnerable contract to avoid the hack to happen.
